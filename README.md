# Welcome aboard! :hand:
## I'm Bogdan, and here is some basic info about me:

- I'm studying Computer science at *University of Belgrade* :serbia:
- I'm into various different programming areas, ***currently*** targeting web
- Here are some langs I mostly work with:
  - C/C++
  - Java
  - Python
- Not mentioning football:soccer: and table tennis:ping_pong: here would be a total disaster:exclamation:

## Goal of my Github profile :computer:

Since studying Computer science requires doing many different projects, I decided to put some interesting ones here, not just for others but also for myself in future.

Some personal projects i find interesting are also present here (or will be).

### More info coming soon :construction_worker:
